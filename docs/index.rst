Mission statement
=================

All the work we do at Speleman Lab depends on the quality of the data
we produce and how we handle it. In these documentation pages, data
protocols that all Lab Speleman lab technicians, PhD students, postdoctoral
researcher's and principal investigators should adhere to are
collected. This is not the Bible, so it will be subject to change.
Always note the version name on the document you are working with, and
check if a more recent version is not available.



General data management obligations
===================================

- Upon joining Speleman Lab, register to the HPC Speleman VO group.
- Upon leaving Speleman Lab, transfer the rights to your HPC data
  folders, to the HPC Speleman VO group administrators.


  
OMICS data collection protocol
==============================

Description
-----------

Protocol to follow for all big data sets: high throughput sequencing
or proteomics.

Protocol
--------

1. Upon receiving data files, check integrity of all files.
2. Collect metadata for all samples related to data files.
3. Do a quality run on the data.
4. If quality satisfying, upload all raw data to `ArrayExpress<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/annotare/login/>`_. An
   additional copy of the data can be kept within the HPC Speleman
   VO's data directory during the project's lifespan up to
   publication. After publication data on ArrayExpress should become
   public and the private copy redundant.
5. Register your dataset at `Lab Speleman omics dataset registration form <https://goo.gl/forms/6gnoGBLhdzPzdajP2>`_
